To get easy_abc.py running on Windows you need to have Python 2.7.10,
and wxPython3.0-win32-3.0.2.0-py27 installed on your system.

You can download Python 2.7 from
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/
and wx python from
http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#msw

In addition you need to install pyparsing-2.0.1-win32-py2.7 and
pywin32-219.win32-py2.7.

If you are running easy_abc.py from a DOS command window, you
should first execute an autoexec.bat file which contains

set path=%path%;C:\python27
set PYTHONPATH=C:\python27\Lib

You need to run the autoexec.bat each time you start up a DOS
command window.

Alternatively you can start easy_abc.py from a Python IDE which
should set the path automatically.

As of EasyABC 1.3.7.4 it is also possible to use Python 3.
The most features are working with the Python 3 version, but uploading tunes (Swedish only) is not possible because the mechanize package is still not ported to Python 3.

You can download Python 3.5 from
https://www.python.org/downloads/

set path=C:\Python35;C:\Python35\Scripts;%path%
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Python35\Lib

Python has a package installer called pip. It is located in the Scripts-folder (C:\Python35\Scripts)

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pywin32
pip install pyparsing
pip install --upgrade --trusted-host wxpython.org --pre -f http://wxpython.org/Phoenix/snapshot-builds/ wxPython_Phoenix

Now EasyABC can be started using:
python easy_abc.py
